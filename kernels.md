## Operating system kernels using ATS
* [Terrier](https://github.com/mrd/terrier) is an ARM-based operating system and a fork of [Puppy](http://github.com/mrd/puppy). It is nearly 9% ATS and 84% C.

## Kernel development resources
* Some kernel development tutorials are available in [[contrib|contrib]] in the [KernelBuilding](https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats-contrib/tree/master/projects/MEDIUM/KernelBuilding) directory. In particular there is a tutorial based on the [singpolyma-kernel](https://singpolyma.net/category/singpolyma-kernel/) kernel programming tutorial, originally written in C by [Stephen Paul Weber](https://singpolyma.net/).
