"Linear types are generally easy to use, with a few exceptions, such as "
"[[dataviewtype|dataviewtype]]s. No knowledge of linear logic formalisms is "
"necessary for using linear types in ATS. Perhaps the main issue for "
"beginners with linear types, or at least linear types in ATS, will be "
"getting used to a somewhat large body of syntactical features; many of these "
"share some overlap in their conceptual usage but operate on different "
"resources. This is somewhat in contrast to dependent types, where the syntax "
"is relatively easy, but keeping track of the logic in one's mind can become "
"quite a burden. This makes using dependent type all too easy to get one in "
"to trouble with the typechecker (see above)."
