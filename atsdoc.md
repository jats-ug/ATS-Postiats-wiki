The command `atsdoc` is a utility (written in ATS1) that can be used on code in ATS2 or ATS1. It has various purposes, ranging from literate programming (the [ATS Book](http://www.ats-lang.org/DOCUMENT/INT2PROGINATS/HTML/book1.html) is written using it) to meta-programming. More concretely, it is used for turning a text file (usually ending in .atxt) laden with *texting function calls* into one in which these calls are replaced with the strings represented by their return values. This utility is designed for people who have some basic knowledge of programmming in ATS.
