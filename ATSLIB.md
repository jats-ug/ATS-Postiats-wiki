ATSLIB is a set of libraries included with ATS, which seems to include all libraries except those included in [[contrib|contrib]] and a few others that are primarily designed to be used by ATS itself, such as [libatslex](../tree/master/libatslex).

ATSLIB currently includes [prelude](../tree/master/prelude), [libc](../tree/master/libc), and [libats](../tree/master/libats) (see [codegen/Makefile_atslib](../tree/master/codegen/Makefile_atslib) for how ATSLIB is built).

Examples using ATSLIB can be found in [doc/EXAMPLE/ATSLIB](../tree/master/doc/EXAMPLE/ATSLIB).
