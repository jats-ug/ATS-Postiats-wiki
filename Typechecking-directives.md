* `$effmask_all` - tells the typechecker to ignore the tracking of function [[effects|effects]], which is not really helpful for most types of programming. It is used by writing `$effmask_all(...)` where the `...` is a function call [\[1\]][1].
* `$showtype` - prints out the type of a value or variable in ATS's internal type representation. Very helpful for understanding type errors, but the exact meaning of the output can still be cryptic for more complicated cases. See [[internal types|Internal types]] for more information and [[error messages|Error messages]] for an example.
