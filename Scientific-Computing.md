ATS has many facilities that enable effective, efficient, and [[safe|safety]] scientific computing. The language's focus on safety and efficiency is obvious, but actually making efficient scientific code is often far from easy (in any language).

## Parallel programming
* [OpenMP](https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats-contrib/tree/master/contrib/OpenMP) For shared memory systems; stands for [Open Multi-Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openmp).
* [MPI](https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats-contrib/tree/master/contrib/MPI) For shared and/or distributed memory systems; stands for [Message Passing Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface).

## Optimization
* Linear and convex optimization: [Gurobi interface](https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats-contrib/tree/master/contrib/gurobi)

## Python [[code generation|code generation]]
Python is perhaps one of the most popular general scientific computing languages, alongside MATLAB, though the R language has a notable lead with available statistics software (particularly related to Biology). 

## Matrix operations
Efficient matrix operations are difficult in practice.
