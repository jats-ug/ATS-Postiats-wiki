Atslib is a set of libraries included with ATS, which seems to include all libraries except those included in [[contrib|contrib]] and a few others that are primarily designed to be used by ATS itself, such as [libatslex](../../tree/master/libatslex).

Atslib currently includes [prelude](../../tree/master/prelude), [libc](../../tree/master/libc), and [libats](../../tree/master/libats) (see [codegen/Makefile_atslib](../../tree/master/codegen/Makefile_atslib) for how atslib is built).

Examples using atslib can be found in [doc/EXAMPLE/ATSLIB](../../tree/master/doc/EXAMPLE/ATSLIB).
