Dataviewtypes are linear analogues of datatypes. As such, their memory must
be managed explicitly, which typically entails creating a free function for
each dataviewtype introduced. Due to potential complexity in type checking
and proofs (as well as it being a concrete type) it is advised to make use
of an [[absviewtype|absviewtype]] provide an interface for dataviewtypes.

## Folding An important notion in dealing with dataviewtypes is being able
to access the arguments of constructors. The implications differ if we want
to use the arguments as l-values or just as r-values. For instance, take the
following example:

```ocaml
datavtype dvt =
  | dvt0 of ()
  | dvt2 of (dvt,dvt)

fun foo (x: !dvt): void =
  case+ x of
  | dvt0 () => ()
  | dvt2 (x1, x2) => ()        // x1 and x2 are values
  | @dvt2 (x1, x2) => fold@(x) // x1 and x2 are l-values
```

Basically, you need to put @ in front of a linear constructor if you want to
use the arguments of the constructor as l-values. Why l-values? Because an
l-value allows its content to be modified. Note that explicit folding
(fold@)  is needed if @ is used.

### A more complex example ###

This example is primarily used to build on the above while introducing a
higher degree of nesting, and is based on an example from the ATS1 wiki
(warning, [external
link](https://sourceforge.net/p/ats-lang/wiki/dataviewtype/)). Also note
that this example doesn't explicitly mention the difference between the
l-values and r-values in the comments, since the difference wasn't
accessible in ATS1:

```ocaml
dataviewtype dvt =
    | dvt_0 of ()
    | dvt_1 of (dvt)
    | dvt_2 of (dvt,dvt)
