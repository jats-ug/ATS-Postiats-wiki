Checking recent edits is a good way to make sure the wiki remains as correct
as possible, as well as a good way to learn new things from other users. The
wiki doesn't support diff view currently, but a regularly updated repository
with diff view is maintained at
https://github.com/bbarker/ATS-Postiats-wiki.

mean listings that are highly incomplete or articles that only barely
scratch the surface.)  * [[char|char]] * [[code generation|code generation]]
* [[loops|loops]] * [[safety|safety]] * [[Scientific Computing|Scientific
Computing]] * [[sort|sort]] * [[template|template]]

about a topic to possibly make improvements listed here.)  * [[char|char]] *
[[sort|sort]] * [[type|type]]

## Mostly ATS1 (Needs to be updated to ATS2)  * [[ATS Libraries and C
