## ATS Compiler atscc, sometimes called patscc in ATS/Postiats, is a wrapper
utility to allow easier compilation of ATS source code than by using patsopt
directly.

Here is more information on 'patscc' and 'patsopt':

http://www.ats-lang.org/RESOURCE/#ATS_utility

In order to compile ATS2 programs, you can now do something like:

``` patscc -o test test.dats test_header.sats test_helper.dats ```

For considerably large and complex projects (involving both ATS code and C
code), it may be beneficial to use 'patsopt' directly in a Makefile. In most
cases, 'patscc' is adequate for handling the compilation of ATS code.
