Several editors support ATS(2).

## Emacs * ATS2-mode supports syntax highlighting of ATS and embedded C
code. For download, see the [official
repository](https://github.com/mrd/ats2-mode) or possible forks
([1](https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats-contrib/blob/master/contrib/libats-/bbarker/emacs/ats2-mode.el),
[2](../tree/master/utils/emacs/ats2-mode.el)).  * ATS2-flymake depends on
ATS2-mode. It is available [with
ATS2/Postiats](../tree/master/utils/emacs/ats2-flymake.el). It can highlight
the location of the source of a type-error pretty well but it may have some
room for improvement. Currently, one can use ` C-x `` (that is backquote) to
locate the source of a type-error. Basically, you can do the following (with
ats2-mode for emacs being turned on):

```
C-c C-c // for compilation
C-x `     // for locating the source of the first error
C-x `     // for locating the source of the next error
```

## Vim There is existing code for a vim mode, but most of the ATS users seem
to use emacs. See [this
issue](https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats/issues/30) for a full
discussion and code links.

## SublimeText This is just a syntax highlight file, not a full mode. You
can install it at the [Package
Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/ATS%20Syntax%20Highlight).
