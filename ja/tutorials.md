For a beginner, perhaps the most important tool to learn is *good functional
style* and *abstraction*. This [code example for a
calculator](http://www.cs.bu.edu/~hwxi/academic/courses/CS320/Spring13/code/calculator/),
while not exactly a tutorial, demonstrates these principles. [Discussion on
the calculator example is located
here](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/ats-lang-users/ad5S6SY0I0E).

Currently, the ATS site has [several tutorials and
references](http://www.ats-lang.org/DOCUMENT/), several of which are
described below. There is also a more [dense tutorial or language overview
reference](http://cs.likai.org/ats/ml-programmers-guide-to-ats) that is
highly recommended.

* Chris Double has written [many blogs on
  ATS](http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/tags/ats/). There are also [many useful
  topical
  tutorials](http://www.ats-lang.org/htdocs-old/TUTORIAL/tutorial.html) on
  the ATS site. Of course, there may be [resources not mentioned
  here](https://www.google.com/search?as_q=ATS+language&as_epq=&as_oq=tutorial+blog+programming&as_eq=&as_nlo=&as_nhi=&lr=&cr=&as_qdr=all&as_sitesearch=&as_occt=any&safe=images&tbs=&as_filetype=&as_rights=).
* [[A Tutorial on Programming Features in
  ATS|http://www.ats-lang.org/DOCUMENT/ATS2TUTORIAL/HTML/book1.html]] covers
  several topics common to many programming languaages, as well as some
  tutorials on linear types.

  ATS/Cairo](http://www.ats-lang.org/DOCUMENT/ATS2CAIRO/HTML/book1.html).

## Algorithms in ATS

**[[The ATS Book|http://www.ats-lang.org/DOCUMENT/INT2PROGINATS/HTML/book1.html]]** is a good source of algorithms at various levels of rigor.

**Rosetta Code** has several [entries for ATS](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:ATS).

Once familiar enough with the language, [[ATSLIB|ATSLIB]] is also a great
source to find many algorithms implemented in ATS, sometimes in several
different ways (linear, non-linear, etc.)

## Other small tutorials

An example demonstrating [dataviewtype]s.

An [ATS wiki
book](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/ATS:_Programming_with_Theorem-Proving)
exists, but currently only has a few pages (and appears to be rather dated,
i.e. uses ATS1).
