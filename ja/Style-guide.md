Functional Programming (FP) style in ATS.
-----------------------------------------------------------


**General Advice**

**(Insert sagely advice in this paragraph)** As with many things, optimal learning can be achieved by different people in different ways. A suggestion for functional programming in general, to those who have experience in imperative programming, is to read examples, understand examples, and ***implement examples***. Much like math or writing literature, most people need practice and experience to really become effective. Abstraction is an important mechanism in making good style (and good code) possible. This [code example for a calculator](http://www.cs.bu.edu/~hwxi/academic/courses/CS320/Spring13/code/calculator/), while not exactly a tutorial, demonstrates these principles. [Discussion on the calculator example is located here](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/ats-lang-users/ad5S6SY0I0E).


(Any good journals or sites accessible to a beginner that aren't ATS
specific but still applicable for an ATS beginner?)

There are many examples in the [ATS2
Book](http://www.ats-lang.org/DOCUMENT/INT2PROGINATS/HTML/book1.html), and
also [some examples listed
separately](http://www.ats-lang.org/htdocs-old/EXAMPLE/example.html).


**Some examples of poor versus good implementations in ATS:**

**Using case with conditionals.**
An alternative to using a string of if-then-else expressions is to use a case-when expression. This is more powerful and elegant than if-then-else because pattern matching can also be integrated, and the syntax is more compact. For a simple example emulating switch-case without pattern matching, see the following:

```ocaml (* We are testing x for several possible values.  We use case+ of
0, but we could use "of anything" since the anything doesn't matter in this
case.  *)  case+ 0 of | _ when x = 1 || x = 3 => print("An odd int < 5\n")
| _ when x = 2 || x = 4 => print("An even int < 5\n")  | _ => print("Not 1,
2, 3, or 4.\n")  ```

**val vs var**
Some very good material on how to deal with val and var bindings, which come from functional and imperative programming respectively, can be found on the [old ATS site](http://www.ats-lang.org/htdocs-old/TUTORIAL/contents/val-and-var.html).

Additionally, some static assignment features supported by val [are
currently unsupported by
var](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/ats-lang-users/V7Mr-NZcB5E/mbaTioLJPv0J),
but in principle could be added. As a work around, intermediate vals can be
used.


**Loops**

Examples abound on using tail-recursive functions as loops in place of while
and for loops to achieve the same effect in a functional programming
style. Often, it is useful to declare a function as being &lt;cloref&gt; to
allow the function to use variables defined outside of its body or argument
list; &lt;cloref&gt; means "the function is a peristent closure that
requires the garbage collector to be
freed".
[Apparently](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/ats-lang-users/2LtZdgNO9W8/H_PjUDG1uUUJ),
this does not mean that a closure is actually created each time a
&lt;cloref&gt; function is called, as it is heap allocated. See [this
tutorial](http://bluishcoder.co.nz/2010/06/20/closures-in-ats.html) for
further details.


Style with dependent types.
---------------------------
Dependent types are often difficult to use, and should be avoided when
possible on the first pass of writing an implementation. Their use can
overly complicate program implementation by a very large margin; so a
non-dependent "program-first program verification" approach, possibly with
linear types, is encouraged.

An example of this is a [[sort|sort]] for doubles and floats, which no
longer exists in ATS due to its propensity for complicating code.

The same caution and program-first program verification approach can likely
be applied to writing proof functions in ATS.


Style with linear types.
---------------------------
Linear types are generally easy to use, with a few exceptions, such as
[[dataviewtype|dataviewtype]]s. No knowledge of linear logic formalisms is
necessary for using linear types in ATS. Perhaps the main issue for
beginners with linear types, or at least linear types in ATS, will be
getting used to a somewhat large body of syntactical features; many of these
share some overlap in their conceptual usage but operate on different
resources. This is somewhat in contrast to dependent types, where the syntax
is relatively easy, but keeping track of the logic in one's mind can become
quite a burden. This makes using dependent type all too easy to get one in
to trouble with the typechecker (see above).

An [example of using linear types with unlimited precision
integers](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/ats-lang-users/Cdk-_gbeVfE)
(using [GMP](http://gmplib.org/)) is available, which should be useful for
beginners to learn linear types.
