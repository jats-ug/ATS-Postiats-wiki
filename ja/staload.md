Note that staload in ATS is a bit like `#include` in C. However, `staload`
and `#include` are implemented totally differently.

By staloading a file 'foo.sats' as follows, a namespace is created for
'foo.sats':

```ocaml staload FOO = "foo.sats" ```

A name xyz declared in 'foo.sats' should be referred to as $FOO.xyz.

If we next do:

```ocaml staload FOO2 = "foo.sats" ``` then there is no actual loading
except FOO2 becomes an alias of FOO.

We can also do

```ocaml staload "foo.sats" ```

which opens up the namespace for 'foo.sats' so that names declared in
'foo.sats' can be referred to directly.

There is also support for `#include` in ATS, which simply pastes any file to
be included at the point where `#include` is located.

Another use of staload is to make template implementations available to the
ATS compiler. For instance, the following line makes the template
implementations in foo.dats available for the purpose of code generation
(from ATS source to C target):

```ocaml staload _ = "foo.dats" ``` The use of '_' is to make sure that
nothing declared in 'foo.dats' gets spilled out accidentally [\[1\]][1].
