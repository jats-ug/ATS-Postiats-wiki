**INV**

INV (for invariant) is essentially marker for typechecking [\[1\]][1]. For
instance, say you have a function foo declared as follows:

```ocaml fun{a:t@ype} foo (xs: list0 (a)): void ```

Assume that `mylst` is of the type `list0 (T)` for some `T`. When
typechecking `foo(mylst)`, the typechecker will expand the expression as
follows by picking a placeholder `T1`:

```ocaml foo<T1>(mylst)  ```

where `T <= T1` is assumed, so that mylst can contain any subtype--in the
[covariant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)#Formal_definition)
sense--of T1 [\[2\]][2]. Say that `foo2` is declared as follows:

```ocaml fun{a:t@ype} foo2 (xs: list0 (INV(a))): void ```

When `foo2(mylst)` is typechecked, the typechecker simply expands the
expression to the following one:

```ocaml foo2<T>(mylst)  ```

preventing types other than precisely `T` to be a part of `mylst`.
