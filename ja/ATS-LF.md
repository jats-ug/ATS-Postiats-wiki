ATS/LF ([Logical
Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_framework)) supports a form
of (interactive) theorem-proving; ATS advocates a programmer-centric
approach to program verification that combines programming with
theorem-proving in a syntactically intertwined manner.

## Proofs, theorems, and axioms

* axiom - `praxi`; States a theorem without proof. Use only under careful
  consideration.
* proof - `prfun`; States a theorem where the author should give a proof,
  however in ATS2, it is currently not required to do so, making it similar
  to a praxi in practice [\[1\]][1].
* proof - `prfn`; non-recursive version of prfun
* theorem - `prop`; a type in ATS that represents a theorem.

Note that proof functions can (and should) be implemented using the
`primplement` keyword, similar to `implement` for dynamic function
implementations. More details can be found in the ATS2 Book.
