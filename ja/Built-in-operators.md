This page lists built-in operators for ATS.

  - `!=` - "Not equal to" (float/double/int). Also the same as <>, but
    preferred since it is easier to read for most and does not share the
    same string as the function effect <>.
  - `<>` - "Not equal to" (float/double/int). Also the same as !=, but not
    recommended in general since it is less common than != in most
    programming languages and does not share the same string as the function
    effect <>.
  - `=>` - Similar to `=`, but used to define the body of a lambda function
    or a case expression.
  - `=>>` - Similar to `=>`, but indicates to the typechecker that this
    clause needs to be typechecked under the sequentiality assumption that
    the given value that matches it does not match the pattern guards
    associated with any previous clauses. For more information, see
    [Sequentiality of Pattern Matching][1] or the [forums][2].
  - `=/=>` - Similar to `=>>` but indicates to the typechecker that the
    proof following `=/=>` must prove falsehood. During compilation (after
    typechecking), the third clause is removed as it can never be chosen at
    run-time [because matching v against yields falsehood][3].
  - `=/=>>` combines the features of `=/=>` and `=>>`.
  - `#` - Allows static variables present in a function return type to be
    used in the statics of the function's arguments. For example, if we want
    `b` from the return type to be in the scope of the statics in the
    arguments, (that is, `b` in `opt (a,b)`):

```ocaml fun{a:t@ype} linset_choose (xs: !set a, x0: &a? >> opt (a, b)) :
#[b:bool] bool (b)  ```
