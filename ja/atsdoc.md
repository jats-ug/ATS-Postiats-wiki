The command `atsdoc` is a utility (written in ATS1) that can be used on code
in ATS2 or ATS1. It has various purposes, ranging from [literate
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) (the [ATS
Book](http://www.ats-lang.org/DOCUMENT/INT2PROGINATS/HTML/book1.html) is
written using it) to
[metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming). More
specifically, it is used for turning a text file (usually ending in .atxt)
laden with *texting function calls* into one in which these calls are
replaced with the strings represented by their return values. This utility
is designed for people who have some basic knowledge of programmming in ATS.
