Runtime errors are unusual in ATS, particularly segmentation faults, but
there are a few common reasons for this. Also see the [[memory leaks|Memory
leaks]] article.

## Unexpected behavior from a C compiler Compiler optimization issues crop
up from time to time, as every compiler is different for some cases.

### GCC * GCC 4.8: possible loop optimization issues: may need
`--fno-aggressive-loop-optimization`


## Segmentation faults

These are generally pretty rare, and can occur because of an unintended
infinite recursion; these are generally easy to find. For more information,
see the [[loops|loops]] article. These can generally be avoid by using
[[termination metrics|termination metrics]], or if no termination proof is
to be provided, the compiler can generate run‑time termination checks, if it
is passed this command‑line option: `-D_ATS_TERMINATION_CHECK`.

If you are doing something unsafe with memory, though, particularly when
interfacing with other C code, there are other possibilities. For more
information, see [[memory leaks|Memory leaks]].
