There are many different string types available in ATS2 (see some of these
in `prelude/basics_sta.sats`). Which should be used?

For something relatively small, using 'strptr1' for strings is fine.

For something more complicated that requires sharing of strings, one may
want to use ref-counted strings. In ATS2, there is a type
[strobjref](https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats/blob/master/libats/SATS/strobjref.sats)
for reference-counted strings.

At the beginning of a project, it is usually uncertain what kind of string
is needed.  An abstract type can be introduced:

```ocaml absviewtype mystring (l:addr)  ```

First, `mystring` can be implemented based on `strptr`. Later, the
implementation can be easily changed, making it based on `strobjref` or
something else.

In practice, if string sharing is allowed. then memory leaks are often very
difficult to prevent.  For instance, there are many leaks in graphviz
(according to bug reports). ATS is very good for stopping this kind of
problems[\[1\]][1].
