ATS has many facilities that enable effective, efficient, and
[[safe|safety]] scientific computing. The language's focus on safety and
efficiency is obvious, but actually making efficient scientific code is
often far from easy (in any language).

## Parallel programming *
[OpenMP](https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats-contrib/tree/master/contrib/OpenMP)
For shared memory systems; stands for [Open
Multi-Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openmp).  *
[MPI](https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats-contrib/tree/master/contrib/MPI)
For shared and/or distributed memory systems; stands for [Message Passing
Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface).

## Optimization * Linear and convex optimization: [Gurobi
interface](https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats-contrib/tree/master/contrib/gurobi)

## Python [[code generation|code generation]] Python is perhaps one of the
most popular general scientific computing languages, alongside MATLAB,
though the R language has a notable lead with available statistics software
(particularly related to Biology).

## Matrix operations Efficient matrix operations are difficult in practice.
