Checking recent edits is a good way to make sure the wiki remains as correct as possible, as well as a good way to learn new things from other users. The wiki doesn't support diff view currently, but a regularly updated repository with diff view is maintained at https://github.com/bbarker/ATS-Postiats-wiki.
