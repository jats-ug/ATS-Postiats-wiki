* [ATS Resources](http://www.ats-lang.org/RESOURCE/).  Not strictly libraries, but useful for many projects.


+ [ATSfloat](http://scg.ece.ucsb.edu/ats.html).  ATSfloat is a layer written on top of the ATS CBLAS and LAPACK interfaces. The primary function of ATSfloat is to provide convenient and uniform ATS style access to BLAS and LAPACK routines. However, I also intend to interface to other numerical libraries that I need. For example, currently ATSfloat already has a partial interface to libsndfile. Furthermore, ATSfloat will also contain the codes for the fast algorithms that we are developing for HSS and FMM matrices, and also implementations of GMSN methods for approximation, solution of differential equations and signal and image processing problems.


+ [ATS/OpenGL] Examples on using OpenGL from ATS can be found in the contrib subdirectory in the ATS source.


+ [ATS/Cairo](http://www.ats-lang.org/DOCUMENT/ATSCAIRO/HTML/book1.html) Information on using the 2d graphics library Cairo from ATS. Also see the contrib subdirectory in the ATS source.


+ [ATS/GTK] Examples on using GTK from ATS can be found in the contrib subdirectory in the ATS source.


+ [ATS/pango] Examples on using pango from ATS can be found in the contrib subdirectory in the ATS source.


+ [ATS/glib] Examples on using glib from ATS can be found in the contrib subdirectory in the ATS source.


+ [ATS/X11] Examples on using X11 from ATS can be found in the contrib subdirectory in the ATS source.


+ [ATS/MySQL] Examples on using MySQL from ATS can be found in the contrib subdirectory in the ATS source.
